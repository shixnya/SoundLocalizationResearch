This is a software package and example data that are necessary to reproduce the essential results in the manuscript
"Spectral cues are necessary to encode azimuthal auditory space in the mouse superior colliculus"
submitted to Nature Communications.

Authors: Shinya Ito, Yufei Si, David A. Feldheim, Alan M. Litke

System requirements
Statistics and Machine learning Toolbox
macOS 10.14.6
Matlab R2019a
The code may work with older versions of OS and matlab, but not tested.
macOS is necessary to run fitting function 'fminuit' (Mex file).
(It should work on Windows if you install fminuit from authors website.
http://www.fis.unipr.it/~giuseppe.allodi/Fminuit/Fminuit_intro.html)


How to install
1. Unzip the compressed file (it will take less than a minute)

How to run
1. Open Matlab, and go to the folder where there are decompressed files.
2. open 'demo_fitting.m' in matlab editor, and run section by section.


File contents
asdf.mat: Spike data in an ASDF format. Refer to https://github.com/shixnya/transfer-entropy-toolbox/blob/wiki/Documentation.md for details.
AuditorySpotSummary_1.mat: A summary of the analysis that contains significant test results and fit results. The demo file is able to generate this file under a system tha satisfy the requirements above.
ttlTimes.mat: Timings of TTL pulses associated with auditory stimuli.
EncoderLocomotion.mat: Locomotion activity measured by rotary encoder.
gen5/fullfield.txt: Information of the stimulus order (generated by stimulation software)
segmentlengths.mat: A file that contains lengths of each experimental segment.
segttls.mat: TTL timings associated with auditory stimuli. Separated into each segment.
wflabels.mat: Waveform label information. 1,2: cell body, 3: axon, 4: other shapes
xy.mat: XY coordinate of the neuron relative to the silicon probe. X is parallel to shanks, Y is perpendicular to shanks.


Programs folder contains all of the codes used by the demo.
